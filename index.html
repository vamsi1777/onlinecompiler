                    We Are Students of MPC college, We are doing This project for students and teachers.
                    For teacher's they can easily teach the subject of web development through This website.
                    This website has a good looking web designs and We used html, css, javascript languages to create
                    this website. If you want more details Click <span class="ice" >"online code editor"</span> button in home page.

                    <br> About Our Project:
                    <br>
                    Nowadavs, there are many code editors available on internet but this online code editor is the
                    simplest way to edit your code and we are providing many books for reading and learning web
                    development subject in this website. Using this online code editor, users can easily practice their
                    coding for web development. 
                    This website is also used in school and colleges for teachers to teach web programming and
                    teachers can easily use this code editor because it is a very powerful and is compatible with all
                    computer systems.
                    This online coder supports Windows, Linux and Macintosh and Android platforms. The
                    output for the user typed code is displayed dynamically as the user enters it. This platform reduces
                    the cost required for buying each programming software to practice the programming language.
                    By selecting the specific language to code, the user could learn the programming language
                    just by typing the programming code and view their results dynamically in the results space.
